               There are 12 moves that we need to notate for. Those are U, F, R, B, L, and D, and all of their primes. A normal move, indicated by one of those 6 letters, involves turning that face clockwise. U for up face, F for front face, R for right face, B for back face, L for left face, and D for down face.
