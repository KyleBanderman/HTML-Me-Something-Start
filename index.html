               Do you want to solve a Rubik's cube? <a id="link"href="baby.html" target="_blank">No?</a> Now, that we got that out of the way. Welcome to this tutorial on how to solve everyone's favorite pile of colored cubes, the Rubik's Cube.
               But first, we need to go over some notation. I'll be listing moves to perform on the Rubik's Cube using a notation. This makes it faster to type all this out, as well as shortening the algorithms we wil go over later.
            </p>
            <p id="paragraph">
               There are 12 moves that we need to notate for. Those are U, F, R, B, L, and D, and all of their primes. A normal move, indicated by one of those 6 letters, involves turning that face clockwise. U for up face, F for front face, R for right face, B for back face, L for left face, and D for down face.
            </p>
            <p id="paragraph">
               The other 6 moves are the prime moves, indicated by one of the 6 letters followed by a '. These moves involve turning the face counter-clockwise. The 12 moves are on the right of the screen.
            </p>
            <p id="paragraph">The other thing to notate is the pieces of the Rubik's Cube. There are 3 types of pieces on the Rubik's Cube. The corners, edges, and centers. Each piece is highlighted and labeled on the right of the screen.</p>
            <p class="funParagraph">Now let's go over the steps to solving a Rubik's Cube. There are 6 steps to solving one. They are: White Cross, White Corners, Middle Edges, Yellow Cross, Yellow Corners, and Last Layer. Let's start with the first step, White Cross.</p>
            <br>
            <p id="paragraph">Step 1: To solve the white cross, we need to first find the white center and white edges. The white center is the center piece that is painted white. It is on the U face of the picture on the right. A white edge is any edge that has one of the two colors as white. It is circled on the right. To solve this step, we need to take these 4 edges and position them so they line up with the centers. An example with two of these edges solved is on the right. There isn't any algorithms for this step. You can solve this by just turning the cube without any direction besides getting the white edges in place. Once you have all 4 solved, you can move to the second step.</p>
            <p id="paragraph">Step 2: To solve the white corners, we need to locate the 4 white corners. A white corner, just like the edges, is any corner with a white piece on it. To solve this step, we need to find the corner and place it so it lines up with the edges. An example of a corner being placed wrong and right. To place these corners, move an edge down and then move the corner so the white pieces line up. An example of this is on the right.</p>
